Each mod has a readme file to give a quick overview of its features. It's formatted for github markdown, so it's better to read them directly in github, by clicking on each mod above. This way you get the hyperlinks and the images.  


All mods are built for being deployed with [SDX Launcher version 0.72c](https://github.com/SphereII/SDXWorkshop/blob/master/SDX0.7.2c.zip).
