# Merchant Workstations ![img](https://manux32.github.io/7dtd_miscImages/traderVendingMachine.png) ![img](Icons/workstationQuest.png)

A modified/improved version of [**Valmar**](https://7daystodie.com/forums/showthread.php?32219-Valmar-s-Mod-Collection)'s merchant workstations.  
If you are tired of running arround the map to go sell your loot or to find the rare item you are missing, this is the mod for you.

### Workstations
Both workstations can be picked up if they are within a land claim block range.
- **Merchant Delivery Box**: Like having a Trader at home. Buy or sell goods. Same items and UI as a Trader, even the secret stash is there.
- **Quest Board**: Buy quests.  


### Progression
You need secret stash 3 and craftSkillScience 5 to be able to craft the workstations. They can also be purchased at traders (stashOnlyItemsHigh).
