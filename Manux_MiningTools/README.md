# Mining Tools
Small adaptation of **Buggi**'s [Lightweight Builders Mod](https://7daystodie.com/forums/showthread.php?84086-Lightweight-Builders-Mod) mining tools, packaged as an SDX mod for easy merging with other SDX mods.  
I think some of those originally came from **Valmar**'s mod.  
I did not yet add any progression gates for being able to craft these items.

### Weed Cleaver ![wc](Icons/weedCleaver.png)
To get rid of those pesky weeds quicly.

### Quick Axe ![qa](Icons/quickaxe.png)
A versatile and powerful mining tool. Like having a FireAxe, a PickAxe, and a Shovel, all in the same tool.

### Diamond Axe ![da](Icons/diamondaxe.png)
A super Quick Axe. The most versatile and powerful mining tool.
