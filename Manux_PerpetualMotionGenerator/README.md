# Perpetual Motion Generator ![pmg](Icons/perpetualMotionGenerator.png)
A generator that requires no fuel whatsoever.  
We don't know who managed to invent this, it was considered scientifically impossible for ages.  
We may have stolen it from Aliens or something. It cannot be crafted, only purchased or found in the world.  

### Perpetual Motion Generator Magnet ![pmgm](Icons/perpetualMotionGeneratorMagnet.png)
- Place Perpetual Motion Generator Magnets into a Perpetual Motion Generator to generate free power
- Magnets are bit like batteries, but they will degrade **very very very** slowly. The generator is like a battery bank so you connect a power source to it to re-magnetize (recharge) the magnets. You don't need a lot of power for that, and they re-magnetize very quickly.
