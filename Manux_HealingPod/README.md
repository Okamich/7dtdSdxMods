# Healing Pod ![healingPod](Icons/healingPod.png)

A healing pod heals you and cures everything quickly when you step on it.  
It requires 50W of power to work.  
We don't know what kind of magic makes this thing do all that, all we know is it cannot be crafted, only purchased or found in the world.
