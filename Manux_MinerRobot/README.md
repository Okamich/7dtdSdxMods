# Manux_MinerRobot ![miner](Icons/minerGeneric.png)

This was inspired by **YoShIWoZ**'s [Miner mod](https://7daystodie.com/forums/showthread.php?47379-Miner).  
A Miner Robot is a device that mines ressources for you.  
The device does not actually move arround to mine real blocks. It will just spawn a loot container on top of it when it's done "mining".

### Blocks:
- **Miner Robot (Generic Device)**: A non-Active Generic version of the Miner Robot. Convert it to a specific ore group version of the device to activate it.
- **Miner Robot (Regular Ores)**: Harvests regular Ores (rockSmall, dirtFragment, crushedSand, clayLump)
- **Miner Robot (Rare Ores)**: Harvests rare Ores (ironFragment, coal, oilShale, scrapLead, potassiumNitratePowder), and more rarely, very rare ores (silverNugget, goldNugget, rawDiamond)

### Progression
- You need craftSkillTools 6 and craftSkillScience 6 to craft the Generic Miner Robot.
- CraftSkillTools 4 and craftSkillScience 3 to convert a generic device to the Regular Ores version.
- CraftSkillTools 7 and craftSkillScience 7 to convert a generic device to the Rare Ores version.

### Usage:
- Buy, craft or find the generic device.
- Convert it to either the Regular Ores or the Rare Ores version using the appropriate workbench recipe.
- Place the device somewhere.
- Upgrade it with gas using a clawhammer or a wrench to start the Robot (Regular Ores: 1000 gas / Rare Ores: 1500 gas). 
- You will see it's lights turn on, the auger blade will start to turn and you will hear its noise.
- The mining time is currently arround 60 real-time minutes (random).
- A lootable chest will appear on top of it when its done. The device will also turn off.
