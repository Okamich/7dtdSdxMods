# Manux_HPMiniBike

This mod adds High-Powered versions of the minibike parts, in order to build a High-Powered Minibike.  
I wanted a faster bike especially for Random Gen maps where cities are pretty far from each other.  
I haven't made new meshes for the new parts yet, so it looks the same as usual, it's just more powerful.

### New High-Powered Parts:
- ![bigEngine](Icons/bigEngine.png) **Big Engine**: A bigger, more robust, and more powerful engine for your minibike. It consumes a bit more gas but features a bigger gas tank. You can accellerate faster and reach very high speeds, but be careful, it also jumps way higher!
- ![robustMinibikeChassis](Icons/robustMinibikeChassis.png) **Robust Minibike Chassis (Power suspension)**: A more robust minibike chassis equipped with power suspension. You almost don't get hurt anymore when jumping too high.
- ![professionalMinibikeHandlebars](Icons/professionalMinibikeHandlebars.png) **Professional Minibike Handlebars**: Have better control of your driving with these professional handlebars. They will also degrade slower than regular ones.
- ![HPminibikeWheels](Icons/HPminibikeWheels.png) **High Performance Minibike Wheels**: Have better traction and reduced drag with these beautiful minibike High Performance tires. They will also degrade slower than regular ones.
- ![deluxeMinibikeSeat](Icons/deluxeMinibikeSeat.png) **Deluxe Minibike Seat**: A beautiful deluxe comfy seat that drains less stamina when the bike is damaged. The seat is also more robust and will degrade slower.
