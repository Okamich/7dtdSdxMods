# Bad Company Zombies <a href="#"><img src="https://manux32.github.io/7dtd_miscImages/BadCompanyZombies_logo.jpg" width="10%" height="10%"></a>  

This mod includes all the [**Bad Company**](https://7daystodie.com/forums/showthread.php?52099-Bad-Company) mod Zombies, packaged as an SDX mod for easy deployment with other mods.  
It does not include their Bandits, and no rwgmixer either.  

More than 100 new zombies and their variations. There's so many that you'll rarely see the same zombie twice!
