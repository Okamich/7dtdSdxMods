# Basic Fishing
A simple Fishing mod, inspired by **Clockwork Orange** and **Carzilla**'s Fishing mods.  
I'm also using many icons from their mods.  
The mods were adapted to what I wanted, especially making it easier to bait the Fishing Rod, without using a recipe each time.  
Read the items in the localization file or in-game to know how to fish.
