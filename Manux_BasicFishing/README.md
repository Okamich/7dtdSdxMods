# Manux_BasicFishing
A simple Fishing mod, inspired by **Clockwork Orange** and **Carzilla**'s Fishing mods.  
I'm also using many icons from their mods.  
The mods were adapted to what I wanted, especially making it easier to bait the Fishing Rod, without using a recipe each time.  
Read the items in the localization file or in-game to know how to fish.  

### Items and recipes:
- Fishing Rod
- Fishing Trap
- Fish Bait
- Fish bait baskets
- Raw Fish
- Grilled Fish
- Boiled Fish
- Charred Fish
- Fish Stew
- Fish And Chips
