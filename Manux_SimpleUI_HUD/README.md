# Simple UI HUD

This is the UI HUD part of **stedman420**'s [**Simple UI Plus**](https://7daystodie.com/forums/showthread.php?67506-Simple-UI-Plus) mod, packaged as an SDX mod, for easy merging with other SDX mods.  
It does not include the larger backpack, minibike storage and the other increased slots features. I packaged those seperately in the mod [Manux_BiggerBackPackMiniBikeContainersCraftingSlots](../Manux_BiggerBackPackMiniBikeContainersCraftingSlots).
