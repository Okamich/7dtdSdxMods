The Custom Vehicles mod is there to help you build your own custom vehicles, from custom Bikes to custom Cars, Quads, Trucks.  
You can make all-terrain vehicles that can climb small and medium objects, and control the camera distance, and player position/orientation on the vehicle.  
It contains multiple different examples of already functionnal bikes and cars.  

## Professional High-Powered Parts:
This mod also adds Professional High-Powered versions of the minibike parts, in order to build High-Powered Vehicles.  
I wanted a faster bike especially for Random Gen maps where cities are pretty far from each other.  
Only the Hell Goat bike currently uses them, but based on that example, you can use them for other vehicles and make new versions of some of the parts for different types of vehicles.
I did not yet add any progression gates for being able to craft these items.

A big, robust, and powerful engine for your bigger vehicles. It consumes a bit more gas but features a bigger gas tank. You can accellerate faster and reach very high speeds, but be careful, it also jumps way higher!
