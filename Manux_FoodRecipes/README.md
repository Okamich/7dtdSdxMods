# Food Recipes

New Food recipes and small variations to existing ones.  
Some recipes and icons come from [**Valmar**](https://7daystodie.com/forums/showthread.php?32219-Valmar-s-Mod-Collection)'s mod.  

The idea for me was not to do a big change to food, but just add a bit more variety and especially alternatives for foods that can fill you up.

### Alternative Recipes
**Meat and Vegetable Stews** can be crafted with **Assorted Vegetables** instead of the vanilla veggie ingredients.  
Assorted Vegetables can be crafted from potatoes, corn or mushrooms. If you use the 3 types of veggies to craft it, you get more out of it.
