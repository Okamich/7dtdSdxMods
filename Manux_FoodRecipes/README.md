# Manux_FoodRecipes

New Food recipes and small variations to existing ones.  
Some recipes and icons come from **Valmar**'s mod.  

The idea for me was not to do a big change to food, but just add a bit more variety and especially alternatives for foods that can fill you up.

### New Items/Recipes:
- Assorted Vegetables
- Burger And Fries
- Bacon Egg Sandwich
- Scrambled Eggs
- Omelet
- Raw Pasta
- Sheperds Pie
- Pad Thai
- Steak Sandwich

### Alternative Recipes:
Meat and Vegetable Stews can be crafted with Assorted Vegetables instead of the vanilla veggie ingredients.
Assorted Vegetables can be crafted from potatoes, corn or mushrooms. If you use the 3 types of veggies to craft it, you get more out of it.
