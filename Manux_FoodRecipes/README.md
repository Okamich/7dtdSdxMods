# Manux_FoodRecipes

New Food recipes and small variations to existing ones.  
Some recipes and icons come from **Valmar**'s mod.  

The idea for me was not to do a big change to food, but just add a bit more variety and especially alternatives for foods that can fill you up.

### New Items/Recipes:
- ![Assorted Vegetables](Icons/assortedVegetables.png) Assorted Vegetables
- ![Burger And Fries](Icons/burgerAndFries.png) Burger And Fries
- ![Bacon Egg Sandwich](Icons/baconEggSandwich.png) Bacon Egg Sandwich
- ![Scrambled Eggs](Icons/scrambledEggs.png) Scrambled Eggs
- ![Omelet](Icons/Omelet.png) Omelet
- ![Raw Pasta](Icons/rawPasta.png) Raw Pasta
- ![Sheperds Pie](Icons/sheperdsPie.png) Sheperds Pie
- ![Pad Thai](Icons/padThai.png) Pad Thai
- ![Steak Sandwich](Icons/steakSandwich.png) Steak Sandwich

### Alternative Recipes:
Meat and Vegetable Stews can be crafted with Assorted Vegetables instead of the vanilla veggie ingredients.
Assorted Vegetables can be crafted from potatoes, corn or mushrooms. If you use the 3 types of veggies to craft it, you get more out of it.
