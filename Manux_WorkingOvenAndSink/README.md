# Working Oven And Sink
A modified/improved version of [**Valmar**](https://7daystodie.com/forums/showthread.php?32219-Valmar-s-Mod-Collection)'s working oven and sink.  

The main difference with Valmar's original features is that the workstations can be picked up to be placed somewhere else.  
Buckets can also be filled using the sink.  

If you don't know these Valmar features already, here's a quick description:
- **Oven Repair Kit**: This kit can be used to upgrade broken ovens into new working variants with a wrench.
- **Plumbing Kit**: This kit when used with a wrench can upgrade broken sinks into working variants for a fresh source of water.
- **Working Ovens**: Can be used to cook recipes without using any fuel.
- **Working Sinks**: Can be used as a source of clean water. Fill your jars with water by left-clicking with them.
