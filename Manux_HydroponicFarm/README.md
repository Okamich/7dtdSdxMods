# Hydroponic Farming Device ![hydroFarm](Icons/hydroponicFarmPower.png)

This is one of the mods I'm the most proud of.  
If like me, you're not a big fan of the 7d2d farming workflow (lagging, tedious, repetitive, annoying planting/harvesting UI), you will most likely enjoy this mod.  
An Hydroponic Farming Device lets you grow crops quickly and easily, just like crafting recipes at a workstation.  
It works indoors and is more performant than regular outdoor farming.  
It requires 20W of power to work, crops stop growing(crafting) when there is no power.  

### Progression:
- ![hydroBook](Icons/hydroponicsBook.png) An Hydropnics book must be found to be able to use the device.
- 2 levels of **Hydroponics Mastery** must be purchased to acquire more plants recipes and to be able to craft the device. The device can also be bought from Traders or found in the world.

### Quick testing of the Mod:
If you want to quickly test the device in creative mod, you can comment out the progression block and the Hydroponics book item, before deploying the mod.  
You can also make crafting faster by lowering the craft time of all plants recipes.

### How to use the device:
- Purchase, find or craft an Hydroponic device. Or use creative mode to get the *Hydroponic Farming Device* block.
- Place the block somewhere where you can power it. The block has a MultiBlockDim of "1,5,2".
- Placing the block will automatically spawn the Hydroponic Workstation on top of the Hydroponic Power Block.
- Connect Power to the Power Block (bottom block).
- Open the workstation that's on top of it to craft recipes for plants.
- You need either 50 seeds or 50 harvested plants/veggies/fruits to craft a recipe. It will output 3 times that when it's done. (4 times for corn).
- Most recipes take 50 real-time minutes to craft. Mushrooms take double of that.
- When a plant is growing/crafting, you will see that plant spawn on top of the workstation to indicate what is currently being grown by that device.
- Power outage will pause crafting until it is restored.
