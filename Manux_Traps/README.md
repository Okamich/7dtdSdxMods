# Traps

The Steel Log Spikes upgrades were inspired by [**Valmar**](https://7daystodie.com/forums/showthread.php?32219-Valmar-s-Mod-Collection)'s traps, but adapted to what I wanted, including being able to power them for an additonal shocking buff.  
The hard-core players might find my traps a bit over-powered. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

## Adhesive Steel Electric Log Spike: ![taess](Icons/trapAdhesiveElectricSteelSpike.png)

- RequiredPower = 5 (for additional shocks)

## Adhesive Steel Electric Log Fire Spike: ![taesfs](Icons/trapAdhesiveElectricSteelFireSpike.png)
A steel log spike that slows down enemies like a barb fence and that also puts them on fire. Power it to also give electric shocks.
