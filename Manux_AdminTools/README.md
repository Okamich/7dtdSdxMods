# Manux_AdminTools
A couple of simple useful admin Tools.
Some of them are pieces I took from the **Bad Company** mod and adapted.

- *Black Pill*: Cures pretty much everything, and fills Health, Stamina, Wellness, Food and Water.
- *Super Digger*: The already existing commented Super Digger.
- *Grass Bomb*: A throwable that gets rid of grass and plants quickly.
- *Terrain Cleaner Bomb*: A throwable that cleans a terrain quickly (grass, plants, wood, rocks).
- *Get skill points*: 4 "fake" quests to give yourself skill points:
	- adminskill5
	- adminskill15
	- adminskill25
	- adminskill50
- *listspawnableentities console command*: A new console command to list all spawnable entities, with an optional "contains(string)" parameter:
	- You will need StompyNZ's ConsoleCmd mod for this one to work.
	- Command: *listspawnableentities* or *lse*
	- *lse* : lists all spawnable entities.
	- *lse yoursearchstring* : to list all spawnable entities that contain the specified string.
