# Manux_AdminTools
A couple of simple useful admin Tools.
Some of them are pieces I took from the **Bad Company** mod and adapted.

- Black Pill: Cures pretty much everything, and fills Health, Stamina, Wellness, Food and Water.
- Super Digger: The already existing commented Super Digger.
- Grass Bomb: A throwable that gets rid of grass and plants quickly.
- Terrain Cleaner Bomb: A throwable that cleans a terrain quickly (grass, plants, wood, rocks).
- 4 "fake" quests to give yourself skill points:
	- adminskill5
	- adminskill15
	- adminskill25
	- adminskill50
